/**
 * <u>Part 2</u>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A static variable (can be seen in Java as a class variable) is shared by all objects of the class</li>
 *     <li>Static variables are initialized when class is loaded (so <i>only once</i> per class,
 *         before any object of that class is created)</li>
 *     <li>static constants = static final variables; they are quite common
 *         (in contrast to mutable static variables)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A common use for static methods is a factory method - a static method that returns new instances of the class
 *         (presented in the next section)</li>
 *     <li>Static methods are methods that do not operate on objects (they do not receive an implicit first argument), i.e.
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>{@code o1.staticMet(arg1, arg2) = C1.staticMet(arg1, arg2)} (possible but considered as bad style!)</li>
 *         <li>{@code o1.instanceMet(arg1, arg2) = C1.staticMet(o1, arg1, arg2)} (conceptually only, does not compile)</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     where C1 is the class in which {@code staticMet} and {@code instanceMet} are defined
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *     <b>Question 1</b> : <br>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li><b>static variable</b> acts like a <b>global variable</b>. They are <b>accessible
 *         before the object exists</b></li>
 *         <li><b>static constants</b> help reduce the usage of memory. By using static
 *         Java don't allocate more memory, there <b>will be only one copy of the constant
 *         shared by everyone</b>.</li>
 *         <li><b>static method</b> can only call other static methods and can access static data
 *         only. It cannot be refered with "super" or "this".<b>They belongs more to the class
 *         than an instance itself.</b></li>
 *         <p>  +</p>
 *         <li>static class are used as a nested class (i.e. inside of another class).</li>
 *     </ul>
